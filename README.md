I have build a responsive **Resource Management Admin Portal**.




In this portal, the users can view the list of all resources and tag wise resources and also users can search resources by the resource name.
- I've implemented different routes for features like Home, Create Item amd Not Found by using React route components like Routes, Route, Link.
- Used figma mockups to implement UI rich and pixel perfect components.
- Used fetch to call REST APIs for list of resources.
- Implemented Pagination where users can navigate between the pages.
- The user will be navigated to the CreateItem page when clicking on the Add Iem button.
- I added validations ie. empty validations and character limit.
- Implemente Toastify to show successful item creation and for errors(validation errors or API failure) using React third party libraries called React Toastify.
